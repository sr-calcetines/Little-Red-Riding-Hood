        <p>
            Once upon a time, there was a little girl who lived in a village near
            the forest. Whenever she went out, the little girl wore a red riding
            cloak, so everyone in the village called her Little Red Riding Hood.
        </p>

        <p>
            One morning, Little Red Riding Hood asked her mother if she could go to
            visit her grandmother, as it had been a while since they'd seen each
            other. "That's a good idea," her mother said. So they packed a nice
            basket for Little Red Riding Hood to take to her grandmother.
        </p>

        <p>
            When the basket was ready, the little girl put on her red cloak and
            kissed her mother goodbye. "Remember, go straight to Grandma's house,"
            her mother cautioned. "Don't dawdle along the way and please don't talk
            to strangers! The woods are dangerous". "Don't worry, Mommy," said
            Little Red Riding Hood, and with that, she skipped off.
        </p>

        <p>
            It wasn't long before she noticed a wolf watching her from the shadows
            of the trees. "Good day, Little Red Riding Hood," said the wolf with a
            sly smile. "Thank you, Mr. Wolf," Little Red Riding Hood replied, not
            realizing how dangerous the wolf was. "Where are you going, little
            girl?" asked the wolf, keeping his voice calm and friendly. "I'm going
            to visit my grandmother, who lives just beyond the forest," Little Red
            Riding Hood replied. "Oh, what a charming place she must live in," the
            wolf said, then ran off into the forest.
        </p>

        <p>
            The wolf, of course, took a shortcut and arrived at Grandma's house
            first. He knocked on the door and let himself in. Poor Grandma didn't
            even have time to cry out before the wolf gobbled her up. When Little
            Red Riding Hood arrived, she noticed that something was different.
        </p>

        <p>"Grandmother, what big ears you have!" she said.</p>

        <p>"All the better to hear you with, my dear," replied the wolf.</p>

        <p>"Grandmother, what big eyes you have!"</p>

        <p>"All the better to see you with, my dear," replied the wolf.</p>

        <p>"But Grandmother, what big teeth you have!"</p>

        <p>
            "All the better to eat you with!" growled the wolf, leaping out of the
            bed.
        </p>

        <p>
            Just at that moment, a woodcutter was passing by the house. He heard
            Little Red Riding Hood scream, ran inside, and chased the wolf away.
            Little Red Riding Hood hugged her grandmother, who miraculously was
            unharmed.
        </p>

        <p>And they all lived happily ever after.</p>
